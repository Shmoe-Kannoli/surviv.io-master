# MegaMod (Cobra Bunker Update)
Thanks to DragonFlyerHD for this new update and installation guide (I am currently busy with life). It has everything it had before but it works with the Surviv.io Cobra Bunker update. I still plan to add...

* Aimbot
* Increasable zoom

## Installation:
1. Install the [Resource Override](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/resource-override/pkoacgokdfckfpndoffpifphamojphii) extension for Google Chrome.
2. Go to the Resource Override settings and fill in the following settings:\
Tab URL:  `*surviv.io*`\
From:  `http://surviv.io/js/app.*.js` To:`http://rawgit.com/IceHacks/surviv.io/master/megamod/main.js`
3. Go to [surviv.io](http://surviv.io/) and hit `CTRL` + `F5`

(this works only on Chrome, if you want it for another browser ask for the instructions in an issue)

## Features:
* No roofs or ceilings
* Transparent trees, bushes and tables
* Transparent smoke grenades
* Slightly bigger zoom


Hope you enjoy,
IceHacks
